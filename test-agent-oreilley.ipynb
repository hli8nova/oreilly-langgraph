      "Nelson Mandela (1918-2013) was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary, political leader, and philanthropist who served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election. Mandela is best known for his role in combating the apartheid regime, a system of institutionalized racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the government of South Africa.\n",

      "Mandela was a member of the African National Congress (ANC) and became involved in anti-colonial and African nationalist politics. His activism led to his arrest in 1962, and he was subsequently convicted of sabotage and other charges, sentencing him to life imprisonment. He spent 27 years in prison, most of which was on Robben Island.\n",
      "\n",
      "During his imprisonment, Mandela became a symbol of the struggle against apartheid, gaining international support for his cause. He was released in 1990, and his leadership was instrumental in negotiating the end of apartheid and establishing multiracial elections in 1994. Following his election as president, Mandela focused on reconciliation, nation-building, and addressing the socioeconomic inequalities established during the apartheid era.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mandela received numerous awards for his advocacy for peace and social justice, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993, which he shared with then-President F.W. de Klerk for their efforts to peacefully end apartheid.\n",
